      <p> Our initiative aims to both inform and inspire budding artists. We have a varied selection of different kinds of design, creating a gallery ensured to influence users. But what makes our site unique is the randomness of the images generated. Going into a project with a certain direction may not always be the right decision. This is a chance for all users to becoming motivated, perhaps in ways they aren't expecting.
