  <h1><b> About A.R.T </b> </h1>
      <p> 
        The A.R.T. initiative aims to both inform and inspire budding artists. We have a varied selection of different kinds of design, creating a gallery ensured to influence users. But what makes our site unique is the randomness of the images generated. Going into a project with a certain direction may not always be the right decision. This is an opportunity for all users to become motivated, perhaps in ways they aren't expecting.

    <ul> <b>Some Useful Tips for Navigation:</b>
            <li>The "Color Mode" button generates random background colors to give the users ideas for their own artwork.</li>
            <li>The "Night Mode" button is particularly useful for those who want to explore late into the night without the glare of the screen distracting them.</li>
            <li>The remaining four buttons show four categories of art disciplines. The user can click on each one to shuffle through the provided picture and gain insight.</li>
