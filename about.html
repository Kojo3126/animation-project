  <h1><b> About A.R.T. </b> </h1>
      <p> 
        The A.R.T. initiative aims to inform and inspire both new and returning artists. Within the "Artwork" section, there is a varied selection of different types of design, creating a gallery ensured to influence users.</p>
        <p> What makes A.R.T. unique is the randomness of the images generated. A.R.T. provides an opportunity for those who are unsure of the direction of their project to become inspired, and those who are more certain to gain more exposure, perhaps even in ways they aren't expecting.

    <h2> Some Useful Tips for Navigating the "Artwork" Section: </h2>
    <ul> 
            <li>The "Color Mode" button generates random background colors to give the users ideas for their own artwork.</li>
            <li>The "Night Mode" button is particularly useful for those who want to explore late into the night without the glare of the screen distracting them.</li>
            <li>The remaining four buttons show four categories of art disciplines. The user can click on each one to shuffle through the provided pictures and gain insight.</li>
